Operator-Aware Robust Calibration for Bus-Corridor Digital Twins via Bayesian Optimization and Iterative Ensemble Smoothing
Zonghe Wu, Student Member, IEEE, Yutian You
Abstract— Urban bus corridors are human-centric cyber–physical systems where observed “travel time” often entangles true traffic dynamics with operational semantics such as holding, schedule recovery, and terminal layover. These effects can create long-tail artifacts that undermine identifiability and mislead digital-twin (DT) calibration, particularly when the objective is corridor reliability rather than mean accuracy. This paper proposes Robust Calibration of Mobility Digital Twins (RCMDT), a two-level closed-loop calibration framework that decouples stop-level behavioral inversion from corridor-state reconciliation. The outer loop performs surrogate-assisted Bayesian optimization over stop-related parameters using a Gaussian-process surrogate and expected-improvement acquisition, while the inner loop updates corridor background states via an iterative ensemble smoother against a corridor observation vector. Crucially, calibration and validation are deliberately separated: the optimizer minimizes a scalar calibration loss, whereas validation reports distributional evidence (Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance) and worst-window stress tests without re-optimizing. RCMDT also makes the observation operator auditable: door-to-door (D2D) samples are filtered by a fixed rule set to separate transport and non-transport regimes, preventing the optimizer from “explaining away” regime errors using stop parameters. Experiments on two Hong Kong bus routes show that operator auditing and the Bayesian–assimilation loop substantially improve distributional alignment under next-day transfer and short-horizon stress tests, while preserving cross-corridor feasibility.
INTRODUCTION
Urban bus corridors are quintessential human-centric cyber–physical systems: vehicle motion is jointly shaped by stochastic passenger arrivals, time-varying congestion, and operator interventions such as holding, schedule recovery, and terminal layover. These interacting mechanisms create a persistent “reality gap” between field observations and what an executable simulator predicts, especially when the objective is corridor reliability (e.g., tails and worst-case windows) rather than mean travel time. Digital twins (DTs) aim to bridge this gap by linking data streams to an executable model that supports monitoring, diagnosis, and decision-making, but their effectiveness hinges on (i) identifiability of model parameters and latent states and (ii) the correctness of the observation operator that translates raw sensing into calibration/validation targets. DT surveys highlight that synchronization, uncertainty management, and continuous update are first-class requirements rather than afterthoughts [1], [2]; for bus operations, these requirements are frequently violated by measurement semantics and regime shifts.
A central challenge is measurement semantics in bus operations. Widely used targets—such as door-to-door (D2D) segment travel times derived from GPS/AVL streams—often entangle true traffic dynamics with operational semantics that are not “traffic” in the physical sense. Schedule-driven holding, terminal layover, and stop-related idling can yield long-tail “slow” D2D segments that mimic congestion even when background traffic is uncongested. Meanwhile, sensing and preprocessing introduce systematic distortions: GPS-based distance and speed derivation can inflate distances and bias inferred kinematics [3]. If such artifacts are not separated, standard calibration pipelines may “explain away” macroscopic regime errors by shifting stop-level parameters, producing a tuned model that looks acceptable on average yet transfers poorly across time-of-day regimes, across corridors, or to an unseen day.
Data assimilation provides a principled foundation for reconciling noisy observations with dynamical models and recovering latent system states. Ensemble Kalman filtering has shown that even sparse GPS-enabled probe data can reconstruct highway traffic states when fused with suitable process models [4]. For nonlinear, partially observed systems, iterative ensemble smoothers (IES) and related iterative ensemble methods extend this idea by repeatedly assimilating observations over a time window, improving stability and handling model error more explicitly [5], [6]. These methods are attractive for bus-corridor DTs because corridor background conditions—demand realization, incident-driven congestion, or unmodeled variability—can shift rapidly, and a purely parameter-only calibration may be brittle when the latent corridor regime itself is drifting.
In parallel, transit operations research emphasizes that operational controls directly reshape observed travel times. High-resolution bus GPS has been used to localize congestion hot spots and quantify bottlenecks in urban arterials [7], while real-time scheduling and regulation models (including strategies enabled by flexible line length and intervention policies) aim to stabilize service reliability under uncertainty [8]. Recent work further integrates multiple control levers via deep reinforcement learning to improve robustness under disturbances [9]. The implication for DT calibration is subtle but critical: what the “bus experiences” is jointly produced by traffic physics and control semantics, so a DT that calibrates against un-audited D2D targets may be forced to fit control-induced artifacts with traffic parameters, degrading interpretability and robustness.
Motivated by these gaps, we propose Robust Calibration of Mobility Digital Twins (RCMDT), an operator-aware robust calibration framework for bus-corridor digital twins. RCMDT is a two-level closed loop that decouples (i) stop-behavior inversion from (ii) corridor-state reconciliation. The outer loop (L1) performs surrogate-assisted Bayesian optimization using a Gaussian-process surrogate to search stop-related behavioral parameters under a loss that penalizes average mismatch, dispersion, and tail risk. The inner loop (L2) updates corridor background states via an iterative ensemble smoother against a corridor observation vector, holding stop parameters fixed so that macroscopic regime shifts are handled by state reconciliation rather than by distorting stop-level behavior. Crucially, RCMDT treats the observation operator as a first-class object: raw bus-side observations are transformed into D2D samples and audited by a fixed, logged rule set (Op-L2-v1.1) that separates transport from non-transport regimes. Calibration and validation are deliberately decoupled: the optimizer minimizes a scalar calibration loss, whereas validation reports distribution-level evidence aligned with reliability (e.g., K–S distance and worst-window stress testing) under a strict no-reoptimization protocol. This design is consistent with the broader motivation from distributional robustness: systems should be evaluated against distribution shift and tail behavior rather than only mean accuracy [10].
We evaluate RCMDT on a SUMO-based Hong Kong bus-operation DT. To avoid ad hoc regime labeling and to align reporting with an institutional framing of traffic context, we use the Annual Traffic Census 2024 for peak/off-peak narrative and analysis conventions [11]. We additionally use the Transport Department’s processed Integrated Road Network (IRN) segment-speed product as an independent traffic-only consistency check, together with its official data dictionary [12], [13]. Importantly, external IRN speed is used only for plausibility checking and diagnosis; it does not feed back into threshold setting, rule definition, or parameter/state updates, preserving auditability.
This paper makes three contributions. First, we develop an auditable observation operator that separates transport and non-transport regimes in D2D-derived measurements. Second, we couple GP-based surrogate optimization with IES-based corridor-state reconciliation for joint behavioral calibration and regime-aware state updating. Third, we validate reliability via distribution-level evidence and worst-window stress tests, aligning evaluation with shift-sensitive robustness criteria.
RELATED WORK
Prior studies relevant to robust bus-corridor digital twins can be grouped into five streams.
A. Digital Twin and CPS Architecture
DT surveys frame digital twins as CPS-oriented systems that integrate sensing, connectivity, and analytics to maintain a continuously updated virtual counterpart for monitoring and decision support [1]. Survey literature further stresses that the “twin” is not only a simulator but also a data-to-model update pipeline, where synchronization and uncertainty management are core design requirements [2]. These views motivate calibration as a continuing system-identification problem under uncertainty and drift, rather than a one-off parameter fitting exercise.
B. Measurement Semantics and GPS-Derived Biases 
Many mobility DT pipelines derive calibration targets from GPS/AVL, implicitly assuming that derived distances and speeds are unbiased. However, GPS-based distance reconstruction can systematically inflate distances, which propagates into speed and travel-time statistics and can distort distributional tails [3]. For bus operations, this matters because reliability is often assessed through distributional summaries (e.g., P90) and worst-case windows, which are especially sensitive to heavy-tail contamination and bias amplification.
C. Ensemble Data Assimilation for State Estimation 
Probe observations have been fused with traffic dynamics using ensemble Kalman filtering, demonstrating that latent traffic states can be recovered even under sparse mobile sensing [4]. Iterative ensemble smoothers and iterative ensemble approaches provide window-based refinement under nonlinearity and offer mechanisms to account for model error more explicitly, improving stability when the observation operator is imperfect or the process model is misspecified [5], [6]. These methods provide a natural tool for corridor-state reconciliation in bus DTs, where macroscopic regimes can shift within short horizons.
D. Bus Operations Analytics and Control
Bus operations analytics and control. High-resolution bus GPS data have been used to visualize and identify congestion hot spots in urban arterials, supporting diagnosis and operational analytics at fine spatial granularity [7]. On the operations side, real-time scheduling and regulation models (including flexible line-length strategies) seek to improve reliability through interventions that directly change observed travel times and headways [8]. More recently, integrated multi-strategy control using deep reinforcement learning has been proposed to handle complex disturbances and combine multiple control levers in a unified policy [9]. Collectively, this literature implies that observed bus travel times are a product of both traffic physics and operational semantics, and therefore DT calibration should avoid fitting control-induced artifacts with traffic parameters.
E. Robustness Under Distribution Shift 
Mobility DTs face distribution shifts across time of day, demand realizations, and day-to-day variability. Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and related regularization methods formalize sensitivity control under distribution shift, highlighting the importance of evaluating models against worst-case deviations within an ambiguity set [10]. While RCMDT is not posed as a DRO optimization problem, this viewpoint motivates distribution-level validation (e.g., K–S distance and tail-focused stress testing) rather than relying solely on mean error metrics, particularly when the goal is corridor reliability.
Public-sector traffic products can serve as external consistency checks that help disentangle semantics. For Hong Kong, the Annual Traffic Census provides an institutional reference for traffic context and reporting [11], while the IRN segment-speed product and its data dictionary provide an independent, documented traffic-only signal that can be used for plausibility checks without contaminating the calibration loop [12], [13]. RCMDT therefore integrates these strands by making the observation operator auditable, coupling Bayesian optimization with ensemble smoothing in a closed loop, and validating using distributional evidence under a strict no-reoptimization protocol.
PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Dynamics and State Space
We model corridor reliability as a stochastic input–output mapping jointly driven by microscopic stop behaviors and macroscopic corridor background flow, as formulated in (1):
	\mathrm{y\ =\ M(\theta stop,\ Xcorr,\ \xi),}	(1)
where θstop summarizes stop-level boarding/alighting and dwell heterogeneity, Xcorr summarizes background-flow conditions that determine the experienced traffic regime, and ξ captures randomness that manifests as empirical variability across simulation replications and field observations.
B. Objectives: Calibration versus Validation
Calibration and validation are separated by design in the RCMDT framework. Calibration fits D2D segment travel-time mismatch by minimizing a scalar loss function. In this study, we utilize the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) defined in (2):
	\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{cal}}\mathrm{\ =\ }\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{1}}{\mathrm{n}}\sum_{\mathrm{i=1}}^{\mathrm{n}}\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{2}},	(2)
where ei denotes the D2D travel-time error for sample i. Validation does not trigger re-calibration; it evaluates distributional alignment of D2D travel times under a fixed evaluation window and reports robustness via worst-window stress testing.
C. Distributional Evidence and Operator Audit
   Distributional validation is quantified by the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) distance between empirical CDFs from field and simulation. The K–S statistic, Dn,m, is calculated as shown in (3):
	\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{n,m}}\mathrm{\ =}, sup-x.,,F-n.(x)   ,G-m.(x).,	(3)
   where Fn(x) is the ECDF of observed D2D samples and Gm(x) is the ECDF of simulated D2D samples. To mitigate observability issues and label contamination, we compute (3) after applying an explicit, logged observation-operator audit (Op-L2-v1.1) that separates transport and non-transport regimes.
METHODOLOGY: THE RCMDT FRAMEWORK
A. Architecture: The Bayesian–Assimilation Loop
   The proposed RCMDT framework, illustrated in Fig. 1, adopts a two-level closed loop that cleanly separates behavioral inversion from corridor-state reconciliation. The outer loop (L1) searches stop-related behavioral parameters via surrogate-assisted Bayesian optimization (BO), while the inner loop (L2) updates corridor background states via an iterative ensemble smoother (IES) against a corridor observation vector. Calibration and validation are intentionally decoupled: L1 minimizes a scalar calibration loss, whereas validation reports distributional evidence (K–S) and stress tests without re-optimizing. This organization ensures that microscopic stop effects and macroscopic regime shifts are addressed by different mechanisms, preventing the optimizer from “explaining away” regime errors using stop parameters.
   As shown in the Logbook component of Fig. 1, RCMDT also treats the observation operator as a first-class object. Raw bus-side observations are transformed into D2D samples and audited by Op-L2-v1.1. The audit yields (i) a clean set used for distributional validation and (ii) a flagged bin used for regime diagnostics. Importantly, audit outputs do not change the calibration target inside L1 after the fact; they support validation and interpretation under a fixed, reproducible rule set.

 RCMDT two-level closed loop (L1 BO + L2 IES) with operator-aware filtering (Op-L2-v1.1) and validation-only evidence.
B. Objectives: Calibration versus Validation
The outer loop (L1) builds a Gaussian-process surrogate over the calibration objective with predictive mean  μ(·) and standard deviation σ(·). To efficiently explore the parameter space, RCMDT selects new candidates by maximizing the Expected Improvement (EI) as formulated in (4):
	\mathrm{EI(z)\ =\ (},f-*. -  μ(z)) ∙ Φ(γ) + σ(z) ∙ φ(γ),	(4)
where ,f--. represents the current best observed objective value, and Φ(·), φ(·) are the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF), respectively. The term γ in (4) denotes the standardized improvement, which is defined in (5):
	\mathrm{\gamma\ =\ },,f-* .- μ(z)-σ(z)..	(5)
Each candidate is evaluated by stochastic simulation, producing a set of D2D segment travel-time errors \mathrm{e}_\mathrm{i}. The optimization target is not a simple average error; instead, the implemented calibration loss \mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{L1}} combines baseline fit, dispersion robustness, and a tail-risk term as shown in (6):
	\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{L1}}\mathrm{\ =\ }\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{1}}{\mathrm{n}}\sum\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{i}^\mathrm{2}}\mathrm{\ +\ \alpha(}\frac{\mathrm{1} }{\mathrm{n}}\sum\left|\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{i}\right|\mathrm{\ +\ \lambda std(} \left|\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{i}\right|\mathrm{)} \mathrm{)\ +\ \beta}\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{0.9}}\mathrm{(},e.).	(6)
   In Equation (6), the first term (RMSE) captures the average-fit accuracy. The second term, weighted by\ \mathrm{\alpha}, ensures robustness by penalizing both the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the dispersion (standard deviation) of absolute errors, controlled by λ. Finally, the tail term Q0.9(|e|), weighted by \mathrm{\beta}, explicitly controls the 90th percentile of extreme deviations. This composite structure ensures that the resulting digital twin is consistent with real-world reliability characteristics.
C. L2: Inner Loop—Constraint-Aware Assimilation
   The inner loop (L2) holds the behavioral parameters \mathrm{\theta}_{\mathrm{stop}} fixed and updates the corridor background states x to match a corridor observation vector y. This state reconciliation is achieved via an Iterative Ensemble Smoother (IES) analysis update, as expressed in (7):
	\mathrm{x}^\mathrm{a}\mathrm{\ =\ }\mathrm{x}^\mathrm{f}\mathrm{\ +\ K},y   h,,x-f..., K = ,P-f.,H-T.,,H,P-f.,H-T. + R.--1., (7)
   where xa and xf represent the analyzed and forecast state vectors, respectively. The Kalman gain K is determined by the background error covariance Pf, the observation error covariance R, and the observation operator h(\bullet). In this formulation, the Jacobian H is handled implicitly through ensemble covariance statistics rather than being explicitly constructed. Feasibility is maintained by enforcing parameter bounds and anomaly filtering within the loop. In the RCMDT framework, L2 is responsible for reconciling macroscopic corridor regimes that cannot be explained by stop behavior alone, thereby enabling L1 to focus on stop-related parameters that remain stable across different traffic regimes.
D. Operator-Aware Observation and Stress Testing
   Since bus measurements often mix transport dynamics with operational semantics, RCMDT audits the observation operator during the validation phase. The operator Op-L2-v1.1 filters D2D samples using a fixed decontamination rule set. A critical component is Rule C, which flags a D2D sample when its travel time T exceeds a threshold T* and its effective speed veff falls below v*. Based on audit evidence, we apply fixed thresholds of T* = 325 s and v* = 5 km/h, which are held constant across different routes and experimental windows. Following the audit, distributional alignment is evaluated via the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) distance, Dn,m, as previously defined in (3). This metric is computed after the application of Op-L2-v1.1 to the datasets to ensure that only valid transport regimes are compared. To probe model robustness under regime shifts, a worst-window stress test is implemented within each 1-hour window. Specifically, each hour is partitioned into 15-minute subwindows, and the maximum K–S distance among all valid subwindows is reported as a conservative stress indicator. Finally, we include check-only diagnostics that compare holding proxies with simulated dwell times and contrast full-time versus traffic-only accumulation. These diagnostics help localize mechanism gaps but do not provide feedback for Rule C threshold adjustments, parameter updates, or the Bayesian optimization process.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Testbed and Data Sources
We evaluate RCMDT on a Hong Kong bus-operation DT built on the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). Two KMB routes with different operating characteristics are selected. KMB 68X represents a dense urban service with frequent congestion and stop-and-go patterns, while KMB 960 represents a cross-harbor service where operating states fluctuate more strongly across the time of day.
The primary signal for calibration comes from high-frequency bus-side observations transformed into D2D segment travel times, which align with passenger-experienced reliability and incorporate stop-related delays that dominate bus operations. In addition, we use the Transport Department’s processed Integrated Road Network (IRN) segment-speed product as an external traffic-state verification source [12], [13]. Crucially, IRN speed is used only as an independent consistency check for corridor-state plausibility; it never feeds back into Rule C, threshold setting, or parameter updates.
B. Experimental Plan and Protocol
All experiments are organized using 1-h sliding windows as the basic evaluation unit, applied consistently to both routes. We construct three window sets to support calibration, within-day evaluation, and next-day transfer: Training (Day 1 AM), Testing (Day 1 PM), and Robustness/Transfer (Day 2). During robustness verification, we enforce a parameter-freeze protocol: stop-behavior parameters θstop estimated on Day 1 are kept fixed, and the observation-operator thresholds are fixed globally.
The outer loop runs 40 iterations (15 Latin-hypercube samples followed by 25 BO steps). We treat Route 68X as the minimization target and Route 960 as a constraint anchor, ensuring feasibility across corridors and reducing the risk of over-specializing parameters to a single route.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Measurement Audit and Regime Separation
We first examine the quality of the raw Door-to-Door (D2D) measurements. As illustrated in Fig. 2(a), the raw data during the off-peak transfer test (15:00–16:00) exhibits a severe distribution mismatch compared to valid clean samples. The audit reveals a significant "ghost" tail, where 54.3% of raw samples imply speeds below 5 km/h, with extreme outliers (e.g., 2.0 km/h on Route 960) that contradict physical off-peak conditions. Applying the fixed Rule C (T* ≥ 325 s and v* ≤ 5 km/h), as visualized in the filter logic scatter plot in Fig. 2(b), successfully isolates these non-transport regime samples into a flagged bin, producing a clean set for reliability validation. We use IRN as an external traffic-only consistency check for the same window. During 15:00–16:00, raw D2D shows a heavy <5 km/h tail, yet IRN segment speeds remain high (median 47.2 km/h; minimum 8.4 km/h) [12], [13]. This divergence confirms that the long tail is dominated by operational semantics (e.g., schedule adherence, layover, or holding) rather than kinematic congestion, and therefore should be handled by the observation operator (Rule C) instead of being absorbed by traffic-state calibration.
The necessity of this separation is further corroborated by analyzing vehicle trajectories. Fig. 3 shows cumulative distance versus travel time for Route 960. The "Simulation (full time)" curve, which includes dwelling and holding, deviates significantly from the "Simulation (traffic-only)" curve and the sparse real-world traffic-only observations. This substantial gap supports the conclusion that the observed long tail in the raw data is driven by operational semantics (such as schedule adherence, layover, or holding) rather than kinematic traffic congestion, justifying treating it as an observation-operator issue rather than forcing the traffic model to fit it.

B. Robustness Verification (Distribution-Level)
   Following the audit, we evaluate the distributional alignment of the calibrated model. Fig. 4 presents the Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of speed for the raw operator, the cleaned data (Op-L2-v1.1 / Rule C), and the zero-shot simulation. The K-S statistics explicitly marked in Fig. 4 quantify the improvement: the raw mismatch (K–S ≈ 0.54, Fail) is significantly reduced after applying the operator-aware audit, with alignment improving to K–S = 0.2618 (Pass) between the DT and audited-clean reality. Furthermore, the worst-window stress test validates stability: even when isolating the most challenging valid 15-min subwindow, the metric yields K–S = 0.3337, indicating that the model generalizes without collapsing under short-horizon regime shifts.

C. Calibration Efficiency (BO versus LHS)
   Finally, we assess the optimization efficiency of the outer loop (L1). Fig. 5 compares the performance of Bayesian Optimization (BO) against a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) baseline across 40 iterations (15 LHS + 25 BO). As shown in the "Combined Loss" boxplot in Fig. 5, BO improves the best combined objective from 161.70 (LHS baseline) to 148.20, representing an 8.35% gain. The route-specific RMSE boxplots for 68X and 960 in Fig. 5 further demonstrate that BO effectively lowers the error distribution compared to the initial LHS samples, successfully balancing the minimization target (Route 68X) with the cross-corridor constraint (Route 960). This demonstrates that surrogate-guided search can efficiently navigate the parameter space to find robust solutions.

Calibration efficiency comparison between LHS Initial and Bayesian Optimization across Combined Loss, 68X RMSE, and 960 RMSE. The boxplots show the distribution of RMSE values, indicating better convergence and lower errors with BO.
CONCLUSION
   RCMDT bridges the reality gap in bus-operation digital twins by coupling stop-level behavioral inversion with corridor-state reconciliation through a Bayesian–assimilation loop, while keeping calibration and validation logically separated. The auditable observation-operator design mitigates label contamination from operational semantics and enables reliability evaluation through distributional evidence rather than mean errors alone. Experiments on two Hong Kong routes show that a fixed Rule-C audit can isolate non-transport tails and that the calibrated DT achieves substantially improved K–S alignment under next-day transfer and worst-window stress testing. Future work will focus on online adaptation with streaming observations and explicit modeling of schedule adherence and holding control.
